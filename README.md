# HexPeriment

This is a funny experiment with Hexes. As a board game enthusiasts, I always appreciated how hexes give a new range of possibilities compared to squares.
This little program allowed me to implement mathematical computations in a Hex world among which : A-star pathfinding, line of sight algorithm. Moreover, it was an opportunity to try the Dart language for the first time. Please try playing modifying the maps, character and visibility in order to see the pathfinding in action.
You can have a better understanding of the possibilities offered by this experiment, by clicking on the little "Info" buttons.
